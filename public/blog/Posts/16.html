        	<h2>Know Your Spell</h2>
        </div>
				<p>On Saturday, February 25, about two weeks ago, we were part of WandWorks,
					a fantastic event in the Cotsen Children’s Library. We had accepted our first
					commission work months earlier, for which we were supposed to create a
					Harry Potter spell casting simulation game for kids. It was amazing to
					see so many positive reactions!</p>
				<p>Dana Sheridan, the Education and Outreach Coordinator at Cotsen
					Children’s Library, and one of the main organizers of the event, wrote
					a blog entry featuring the game. We're very grateful to her for all
					the energy and passion she put into this event.

					Please check out the blog post here!</a></p>
				<p>The game is free for download, though it might melt your computer.
					Sorry not sorry; ain’t nobody got time to optimize stuff. Check out the
					<a href="../games/">games</a> section of the website for the download
					link.</p>
